  abstract = {Traditional stochastic programming is risk neutral in the sense that it is concerned with the optimization of an expectation criterion. A common approach to addressing risk in decision making problems is to consider a weighted mean-risk objective, where some dispersion statistic is used as a measure of risk. We investigate the computational suitability of various mean-risk objective functions in addressing risk in stochastic programming models. We prove that the classical mean-variance criterion leads to computational intractability even in the simplest stochastic programs. On the other hand, a number of alternative mean-risk functions are shown to be computationally tractable using slight variants of existing stochastic programming decomposition algorithms. We propose decomposition-based parametric cutting plane algorithms to generate mean-risk efficient frontiers for two particular classes of mean-risk objectives.},

In this paper, we study such risk measures on Orlicz hearts. This includes coherent, convex, and monetary risk measures on Lp-spaces for 1 ≤p {$<$} ∞ and covers a wide range of interesting examples. Moreover, it allows for an elegant duality theory. We prove that every coherent or convex monetary risk measure on an Orlicz heart which is real-valued on a set with non-empty algebraic interior is real-valued on the whole space and admits a robust representation as maximal penalized expectation with respect to different probability measures. We also show that penalty functions of such risk measures have to satisfy a certain growth condition and that our risk measures are Luxemburg-norm Lipschitz-continuous in the coherent case and locally Luxemburg-norm Lipschitz-continuous in the convex monetary case. In the second part of the paper we investigate cash-additive hulls of transformed Luxemburg-norms and expected transformed losses. They provide two general classes of coherent and convex monetary risk measures that include many of the currently known examples as special cases. Explicit formulas for their robust representations and the maximizing probability measures are given.},

In this study, we consider a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming model, where we specify the conditional-value-at-risk (CVaR) as the risk measure. We construct two decomposition algorithms based on the generic Benders-decomposition approach to solve such problems. Both single-cut and multicut versions of the proposed decomposition algorithms are presented. We adapt the concepts of the value of perfect information (VPI) and the value of the stochastic solution (VSS) for the proposed risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming framework and define two stochastic measures on the VPI and VSS. We apply the proposed model to disaster management, which is one of the research fields that can significantly benefit from risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming models. In particular, we consider the problem of determining the response facility locations and the inventory levels of the relief supplies at each facility in the presence of uncertainty in demand and the damage level of the disaster network. We present numerical results to discuss how incorporating a risk measure affects the optimal solutions and demonstrate the computational effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

Developed in parallel to sensitivity analysis, the idea of solving optimization problems for a range and as a function of certain bounded parameters has gained considerable interest. Within the past 10 years, there have been developments in multiple parameters, integer variables, and nonlinearities. In particular, the connection between parametric programming and model predictive control has contributed to an increased interest in the topic. The diversity of its application, from explicit control over bi-level programming to integration of design, scheduling, and control, stems from theoretical and algorithmic advances in multi-parametric programming. State-of-the-art software tools with novel solution approaches have been implemented for many types of multi-parametric programming problems, including multi-parametric mixed-integer programming, multi-parametric nonlinear programming, and multi-parametric bi- and multi-level programming"--},

Recently, mean-risk models - studied in mathematical finance for several decades - have attracted attention in stochastic programming. We consider Conditional Value-at-Risk as risk measure in the framework of two-stage stochastic integer programming. The paper addresses structure, stability, and algorithms for this class of models. In particular, we study continuity properties of the objective function, both with respect to the first-stage decisions and the integrating probability measure. Further, we present an explicit mixed-integer linear programming formulation of the problem when the probability distribution is discrete and finite. Finally, a solution algorithm based on Lagrangean relaxation of nonanticipativity is proposed.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with a special case of multistage optimization problems that unifies the multilevel and multistage stochastic optimization classes. We focus on the cases with two stages that are referred to as two-stage mixed integer stochastic bilevel linear optimization problems (2SMISBLPs). This general framework allows modeling a vast number of applications in which the decisions are made by two possibly competing decision-makers, under uncertainty about the values of some input parameters. In this research effort, we first concentrate on the mixed integer bilevel linear optimization problems (MIBLPs), a special case of 2SMISBLPs. In the first part of this dissertation, we lay the foundations for a theory of valid inequalities for MIBLPs, paralleling the one that already exists in the mixed integer linear optimization problems. Building on this foundation, we describe a comprehensive algorithmic framework for solving MIBLPs using a generalized branch-and-cut approach. The framework presented merges features from existing algorithms (for both traditional mixed integer linear optimization and MIBLPs) with new techniques to produce a flexible and robust framework capable of solving a wide range of bilevel optimization problems. The framework has been fully implemented in the open-source solver MibS. We describe the algorithmic options offered by MibS and present computational results evaluating the effectiveness of the various options for the solution of a number of classes of bilevel optimization problems from the literature. In the second part of this dissertation, we concentrate specifically on the valid inequalities for MIBLPs. We provide an overview of the known techniques for generation of valid inequalities for MIBLPs and describe how they fit into the general classes of valid inequalities. We also propose a method for generating strong valid inequalities for MIBLPs and introduce new classes of strong valid inequalities exploiting this method and the principles of duality. Finally, we describe computational experiments we carried out to test the relative effectiveness of the valid inequalities for MIBLPs using MibS. In the last part, we discuss different algorithmic methods for solution of 2SMISBLPs. These solution methods utilize the algorithms for solving MIBLPs and two-stage mixed integer stochastic linear optimization problems (2SMISLPs). We propose generalizing our suggested branch-and-cut algorithm for MIBLPs to 2SMISBLPs and employing the sample average approximation method for the cases that the branch-and-cut algorithm is not applicable. A heuristic is also proposed for finding feasible solutions. Finally, we provide computational results for the application of the suggested algorithms and the heuristic to two data sets constructed from two test sets of the MIBLPs and 2SMISLPs literature.},

  abstract = {In traditional two-stage mixed-integer recourse models, the expected value of the total costs is minimized. In order to address risk-averse attitudes of decision makers, we consider a weighted mean-risk objective instead. Conditional value-at-risk is used as our risk measure. Integrality conditions on decision variables make the model non-convex and hence, hard to solve. To tackle this problem, we derive convex approximation models and corresponding error bounds, that depend on the total variations of the density functions of the random right-hand side variables in the model. We show that the error bounds converge to zero if these total variations go to zero. In addition, for the special cases of totally unimodular and simple integer recourse models we derive sharper error bounds.},

  abstract = {We consider two-stage risk-averse mixed-integer recourse models with law invariant coherent risk measures. As in the risk-neutral case, these models are generally non-convex as a result of the integer restrictions on the second-stage decision variables and hence, hard to solve. To overcome this issue, we propose a convex approximation approach. We derive a performance guarantee for this approximation in the form of an asymptotic error bound, which depends on the choice of risk measure. This error bound, which extends an existing error bound for the conditional value at risk, shows that our approximation method works particularly well if the distribution of the random parameters in the model is highly dispersed. For special cases we derive tighter, non-asymptotic error bounds. Whereas our error bounds are valid only for a continuously distributed second-stage right-hand side vector, practical optimization methods often require discrete distributions. In this context, we show that our error bounds provide statistical error bounds for the corresponding (discretized) sample average approximation (SAA) model. In addition, we construct a Benders’ decomposition algorithm that uses our convex approximations in an SAA-framework and we provide a performance guarantee for the resulting algorithm solution. Finally, we perform numerical experiments which show that for certain risk measures our approach works even better than our theoretical performance guarantees suggest.},

  abstract = {We develop an exact value function-based approach to solve a class of bilevel integer programs with stochastic right-hand sides. We first study structural properties and design two methods to efficiently construct the value function of a bilevel integer program. Most notably, we generalize the integer complementary slackness theorem to bilevel integer programs. We also show that the value function of a bilevel integer program can be characterized by its values on a set of so-called bilevel minimal vectors. We then solve the value function reformulation of the original bilevel integer program with stochastic right-hand sides using a branch-and-bound algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of our solution methods on a set of randomly generated instances. We also apply the proposed approach to a bilevel facility interdiction problem. Our computational experiments show that the proposed solution methods can efficiently optimize large-scale instances. The performance of our value function-based approach is relatively insensitive to the number of scenarios, but it is sensitive to the number of constraints with stochastic right-hand sides. Summary of Contribution: Bilevel integer programs arise in many different application areas of operations research including supply chain, energy, defense, and revenue management. This paper derives structural properties of the value functions of bilevel integer programs. Furthermore, it proposes exact solution algorithms for a class of bilevel integer programs with stochastic right-hand sides. These algorithms extend the applicability of bilevel integer programs to a larger set of decision-making problems under uncertainty.},
